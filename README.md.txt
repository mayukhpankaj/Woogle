In this pandemic, searching for job/intern is a tough task, scrolling through different platforms, what if you can have Everything at Once !
Search over 5 platforms, A google for work, Woogle.

 * Python 
 * Flask + jinja  
 * Beautiful soup 4 
 * Bootstrap 5 
   *Selenium headless for client-side rendered website ( naukri.com)
   

**Python used with BS4 , Flask , requests , WTForms modules.**- 
     
     1. First user gives job designation / skill & location as input to rendered form. 
     2. User input is passed to 5 functions for each platform like linkedin(input,loc): 
     3. Each function requests search result html document with carefully constructed url 
       * for example https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search?keywords={{ job }}&location= (( loc }}
       * spaces needs to replaced with ' + ', ' - ', '%20' depending on website.

    4. required elements are filtered out with classnames or id_ names with function soup.select , soup.findall.
    
    5. sometimes the desired element is dont have any class or id so , we need to navigate the DOM tree with 
       with BS4 functions like x.next_sibling,  x.find_next_element(), x.contents[3]
    7. element's contents are stored in a dictionary for each job card in results page.
       * example, 
          ` dataframe = { 'title': job-title,
                         'company':company,
                         'a': link,
                         'img': url,
                       }` 
                       
    7. Each function then returns a List of Dictionaries containg each job data. 
       which is passed to render_template function of results page where it's used to 
       recursively display data with help of Jinja with bootstrap cards. 


**UNIQUE üöÄ**

Searching for job/intern is a critical situation and needs on the go solution, this is the reason I went for web application, 
instead of downloading the the gui, just logon & use. 

**TAKEAWAYS üéì**

*improved python skills
    *before using a list of dictionaries , was using a tuple of lists which was bad.
*learned webscraping 
   * BS4 & selenium.
   * navigating the dom tree.
*some new discoveries like,
    * html class id's change with change in useragent, so passing headers is necessary for consistent html code.



**IMPROVEMENT üîç**

* Heroku crashing due to process timeout.
